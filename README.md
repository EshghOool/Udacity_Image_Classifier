# Udacity_Image_Classifier

### Objective:
I train an Image classifier and created a Python application in Pytorch to recognize different species of flowers.

### Description:
This project is broken down into multiple steps:
Load and preprocess the image dataset
Train the image classifier on the dataset
Use the trained classifier, vgg16 and densenet121 to predict image content

### Files:
It includes 3 files:
1) train.py file trains a new network on a dataset of images and let the next user to select number of layers, deep learning model architecture and hyperparameters. 
2) The predict.py script that reads in an image and a checkpoint then prints the most likely image class and it's associated probability. Also, the predict.py script allows users to print out the top K classes along with associated probabilities.
3) And, functions.py file that includes validation and other created applications.
